Format Json
Hello! I'm a different helpful language model, and I'd be happy to assist you with the JSON transformation challenge. Let's go through the requirements and transformation criteria step by step.

Input Transformation:

The input JSON file has a schema-less structure, and the transformation should follow the provided criteria.
The output should be printed to stdout.
Transformation Criteria:

All Nth-level values in the input are represented as Strings with the corresponding data type information.
The transformation should consider the following conventions:
a. JSON Field Keys:

Sanitize the keys by removing leading and trailing whitespace.
Represent keys as Strings.
Omit fields with empty keys.
Omit all invalid fields.
b. Data Types:

S (String): Transform the value to a String data type, sanitize the value by removing leading and trailing whitespace, and transform RFC3339 formatted Strings to Unix Epoch in Numeric data type.
N (Number): Transform the value to the relevant Numeric data type, sanitize the value by removing leading and trailing whitespace, and strip the leading zeros.
BOOL (Boolean): Transform the value to the Boolean data type, sanitize the value by removing leading and trailing whitespace, and handle the specified transformations for true and false values.
NULL: Represent a null literal when the value is true, and omit the field when the value is false, sanitize the value by removing leading and trailing whitespace.
L (List): Transform the list elements to the appropriate data types, maintain the input order, and omit fields with unsupported data types or empty lists.
M (Map): Adhere to all the data type criteria, sort the keys lexically, and omit fields with empty maps.
Output Transformation:

The output should be a JSON array containing a single object with the transformed data.
To implement this transformation, you can use a programming language of your choice, such as Python, JavaScript, or Java. The key steps would be:

Parse the input JSON file.
Iterate through the input data and apply the transformation criteria for each field.
Construct the output JSON object based on the transformed data.
Print the output to stdout.
Let me know if you have any specific questions or need further assistance with the implementation.
